##Title: Why are Type Guards Necessary? Discuss Various Types of Type Guards and Their Use Cases.

In this blog, we will discuss the importance of type Guards, the mechanics of their functioning and enumerate the wide range of types available in TypeScript with practical examples.

##What is the Purpose of Using Type Guards?

TypeScript’s Type Guards ensure better data type usage with the help of the compiler’s ability to refine types within blocks of code. In case of complex types or union types, Type Guards can specify to TypeScript the type of the variable at a given moment. Consequently, this avoids errors during execution since only valid types will be used in operations, leading to enhanced code safety, clarity, and readability.

##A Review on the Different Forms of Type Guards

Type Guards can be implemented in various ways in TypeScript. Let us now examine the different types and the potential situations of application for each type.

1.Type ‘typeof’ Type Guard
The typeof operator is perhaps one of the easiest operators to use in TypeScript in order to narrow down types. Its strength is apparent in dealing with primitive types like string, number, or boolean.
Example:

function displayValue(value: string | number): void {
if (typeof value === "string") {
console.log("String length:", value.length);
} else {
console.log("Number value:", value);
}
}

#2.instanceof Type Guard

The instanceof operator is a type guard, it checks that an object instance of specific class. It helps to limit the custom classes or objects, especially in object-oriented code.

Example:
{
class Dog {
bark() {
console.log("Woof!");
}
}

class Cat {
meow() {
console.log("Meow!");
}
}

function speak(animal: Dog | Cat) {
if (animal instanceof Dog) {
animal.bark();
} else {
animal.meow();
}
}
}

In the example instanceof type guard while using classes, to check if an object is of a particular class. That comes especially handy with objects that inherit the same properties and methods.

3.Custom Type Guards

Custom type guards are a little more flexible because they allow you to define functions that determine whether something is a certain type. These functions return a boolean value and rely on the syntax corresponding to parameterName is Type indicating what specific type they check.

Example:
interface Bird {
fly(): void;
layEggs(): void;
}

interface Fish {
swim(): void;
layEggs(): void;
}

function isFish(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish {
return (pet as Fish).swim !== undefined;
}

function moveAnimal(animal: Fish | Bird) {
if (isFish(animal)) {
animal.swim();
} else {
animal.fly();
}
}

In the example above, isFish() returns a type predicate that checks if something it was given as an argument is of type Fish. IsFish(animal) is true, so TypeScript now realizes that animal IS a Fish.

4.In Operator Type Guard
Another way of narrowing types in TypeScript could be with the 'in' operator, which implicitly narrows types by checking whether a given property is in an object. This will be especially useful when working with objects that have distinctive properties.
Example:
interface Car {
drive(): void;
}

interface Boat {
sail(): void;
}

function operateVehicle(vehicle: Car | Boat) {
if ("drive" in vehicle) {
vehicle.drive();
} else {
vehicle.sail();
}
}

In the example, the in operator checks for the presence of the drive property, which is present on Car. This tells TypeScript that within the if block, vehicle is of type Car and in the else block, it's of type Boat.

5.Discriminated Union Type Guard
Discriminated unions use a common property—most of the time called a "tag"—to distinguish between the variants. This is useful when types can have some common properties but with others that are different.

Example:
interface Square {
kind: "square";
size: number;
}

interface Rectangle {
kind: "rectangle";
width: number;
height: number;
}

interface Circle {
kind: "circle";
radius: number;
}

type Shape = Square | Rectangle | Circle;

function getArea(shape: Shape): number {
switch (shape.kind) {
case "square":
return shape.size _ shape.size;
case "rectangle":
return shape.width _ shape.height;
case "circle":
return Math.PI * shape.radius * shape.radius;
default:
return 0;
}
}

In the example, Shape is a discriminated union where each type has a kind property with a unique string literal ("square", "rectangle", "circle"). In the switch statement it uses the kind property to narrow down each type.

Conclusion
Type Guards are something you can't live without in TypeScript. It's a way for the developer to confidently deal with dynamic types. Whether operating on primitive data, custom classes, interfaces, or complex unions, Type Guard provides the ability to handle your data safely and predictably. The Type Guards available within TypeScript are typeof, instanceof, custom guards, the in operator, and discriminated unions. It enables developers in TypeScript to write code that is more reliable and, by all means, readable. How and when to use each of these type guards is basic knowledge which any TypeScript developer is supposed to know for the purpose of unlocking the full potential of the TypeScript language's type safety.
